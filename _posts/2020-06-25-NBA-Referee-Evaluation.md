## Why Would the National Basketball Association Want to Give Home Teams an Advantage?
Each team in the NBA is currently valued at over 1 billion dollars. To put that number in perspective, if an NBA owner sold his team for that billion dollar vaule, they could buy The British Virgin Islands, and still have 500 million dollars left over. The National Basketball Association makes 20+ billion dollars from two television contracts alone with major networks ESPN and TNT. Think about that, 20 billon dollars from just two companies. Millions of merchandise are sold each year, millions of dollars in ticket sales, millions in sponsorship deals, millions in concession costs, ect; the NBA is a money machine and any negative publicity can be deterimental to that revenue stream.

By now you might be asking yourself "I get the NBA makes a lot money, but why would this mean referees give a slight advantage to home teams?" My answer: In order for the NBA to negotiate high valued television contracts and fill stadiums with fans, it is in the best interest of the NBA Executives to have Home Teams to win as many games as possible. Let me give you an example: this past season the Minnesota Timberwolves were among the bottom five teams in average fan attendance. Low ticket revenue, low concession revenue, low merchandise revenue, low parking revenue, everywhere you category you look at there is low revenue. This was a result of the Timberwolves having the 3rd worst record in the league. The citizens of Minnesota don't want to pay hard earned dollars for a game to watch their team lose. This doesn't just affect the Timberwolves revenue stream either, this impacts the league as whole. When the NBA has a nationally televised Timberwolves home game, and viewers (who don't normally watch the Timberwolves) see a half empty stadium, chances increase that they turn off game. This drives ratings down, makes it harder to negotiate television contracts for the NBA, makes it harder to get sponsors, and slowly we all see the revenue stream dwindle down. Now imagine you an National Basketball Association League Executive, and you notice that when home teams lose money, we as an organization lose money. Would it be in your best interest to try to 'fix' that? I think so, and it's public knowledge that some referees have already been caught doing this.

July 29th, 2008: the National Basketball Association had come under fire after long-term NBA Official, Tim Donaghy, was sentenced to 15 months in Federal Prison for consirpacy to engage in wire fraud and conspiracy to transmit gambling information. He was responsible for officiating 772 regular season games and 20 playoff games. While Mr Donaghy was convicted and served his time, there was still a hurricane of rumors that the state of the NBA was compromised at all levels. Donaghy never named other referees partaking, but he did allude to this being a prevalent issue. Rumors floated around about how the 2002 NBA Playoffs and 2007 NBA Playoffs both had been rigged by league executives. However, despite receiving the spotlight attention, nothing really happened. No further charges were brought to other officials, there was no investigation into whether the 2002 and 2007 playoffs had been rigged, everything just died away like a bad internet meme. Why might these circumstances remain undiscussed by the NBA? In my opinion the answer is simple: Money.

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
