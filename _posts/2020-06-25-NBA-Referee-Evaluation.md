## Why is this important to look at?
July 29th, 2008: the National Basketball Association had come under fire after long-term NBA Official (referee), Tim Donaghy, was sentenced to 15 months in Federal Prison for consirpacy to engage in wire fraud and conspiracy to transmit gambling information. He was responsible for officiating 772 regular season games and 20 playoff games. While Mr Donaghy was convicted and served his time, there was still a hurricane of rumors that the state of the NBA was compromised by all levels. Rumors floated around about other referees, who may have also been responsible for this. Rumors floated around about how the 2002 NBA Playoffs and 2007 NBA Playoffs both had been rigged. However, despite receiving the spotlight attention, nothing really happened. No further charges were brought to other officials, there was no investigation into whether the 2002 and 2007 playoffs had been rigged, everything just died away like a bad internet meme. Why might this have just died away and been forgotten? In my opinion the answer is simple: Money.

Each team in the NBA is currently valuable over 1 billion dollars. The National Basketball Association makes 20+ billion dollars from television contracts with major networks ESPN and TNT. Millions of dollars are sold in merchandise, millions of dollars in ticket sales, millions in sponsorship deals, millions in concession costs, ect; the NBA is a money machine and any bad publicity can be deterimental to that revenue stream.

By now you might be asking yourself "I get the NBA doesn't want bad press because that could affect revenue, but why would this mean the referees give a slight advantage to home teams?" My answer: In order for the NBA to have high ratings and fill stadiums, it is in the best interest of the NBA for Home Teams to win. For example, think about your favorite home town sports team. Maybe you enjoy the National Football League, and your favorite team is the Cincinatti Bengals. The Bengals started off with a record of 0-8, which drove their stadium attendance to be among the worst in the league. People in those metropolitan areas do not want to pay money for tickets to see their team lose; any person knows you can watch them lose for free on TV. This becomes problematic for team owners, when no one wants to fill their stadiums they lose money on tickets, drinks, merchandise, ect. This than becomes problematic for owners of the entire league because, when they put these games on national television and the stadium looks half empty, the viewers at home recognize "if the fans arent evening watching in the stadium, why should I watch?" Boom, there goes your revenue stream. To sum up, it is in the best interest of league owners (of every sport) to have the home teams win or atleast keep the game competitive. Now let me demonstrate how I believe the NBA does this by increasing the likelihood for a foul on the Road (opposing) team

Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
